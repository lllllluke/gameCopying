## Tetris: A Paper Prototype
Let’s say you wanted to make a paper prototype of Tetris. You could cut out little cardboard pieces and put them in a pile. Get someone else to choose them at random and start sliding them down the “board” (a sketch you’ve drawn on a piece of paper), while you grab them, and try to rotate them into place. To complete a line, you have to just use your imagination or pause the game while you cut the pieces with an X-Acto knife. This would not be the perfect Tetris experience, but it might be close enough for you to start to see if you had the right kinds of shapes and also enough to give you some sense of how fast the pieces should drop. And you could get the whole thing going in about fifteen minutes.
