# Introduce
Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders
- greatly popularized arcades and videogames
# Analyzing
## Technology
- the custom motherboard 
	- The first videogame that allowed a player to fight an advancing army
- Most design be 

## Mechanics
- player shoot at advancing aliens 
	- Aliens closest to the player are easier to shoot and worth fewer points
- aliens can shoot back at player
- player can hide behind shields that the alines can destroy
- shields can be destroyed by alines and player
- earn bonus points by shooting a mysterious flying saucer
- the game can end two ways
	- the player’s ships can be destroyed by alien bombs
	- the advancing aliens will eventually reach the player’s home planet
- ==the more of the 48 aliens you destroy, the faster the invading army gets==
	- This builds excitement and makes for the emergence of some interesting stories
	- The first game use difficulty curve amony two continuous levels

## Stroy
- It could have been an abstract game where a triangle shoots at blocks
	- having a story makes it far more exciting and easier to understand
- From fired at an army of advancing human soldiers to advancing aliens
	- A game where you could be in a space battle was actually novel at the time
	- Some people are squeamish about war games where you shoot people
	- The “high-tech” computer graphics lent themselves well to a game with a futuristic theme.
	- Space Invaders gives the sense that the aliens are gradually lowering toward the surface of your planet and you are shooting up at them

## Aesthetics
- There are three different designs of aliens 
	- each worth a different amount of points
- They each perform a simple two-frame “marching” animation
- The display was not capable of color
	- Since the player was confined to the bottom of the screen
		- the aliens to the middle, and the saucer to the top
	- colored strips of translucent plastic were glued to the screen 
		- so that your ship and shields were green, the aliens were white, and the saucer was red
- Audio is another important component
	- made a sort of heartbeat noise
		- as they sped up, the heartbeat sped up
	- when your ship was hit with an alien missile
		- a punishing, buzzing crunch noise
- The cabinet had a design that was attractive and eye-catching
	- helped tell the story of the evil alien invaders
