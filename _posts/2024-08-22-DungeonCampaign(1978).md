- Synergistic Software, Inc., 1978
- Apple II and Atari 8-bit
- a score-driven design
	- mirrors the popular arcade games of the era
---
##  Inspiration
- A series of codes that could be used to generate countless dungeons ready for exploration
	- this was a gold mine for any RPG fan
- Inspired by *Dragon Maze*
	- randomly generated a simple top-down maze
	- a reference manual game of [[The Apple II]]

## Mechaincs
- Level
	- starts by generating four dungeon levels
		- Each of the four levels also has a guardian monster
	- giving time for players to try to map it down with pen and paper
	- starts with 15 nameless members
	- the game ends if your members all die
	- at each victory your members increase their strength
		- This means your 15 warriors will have a strength of 15 at first, go to 30 after the first battle, to 45 after the second, but decrease to 42 if one party member dies. And die they will
	- The dungeon offers a few other perils
		- traps that will randomly send you to other levels
		- rooms filled with toxic gas
- Role
	- Each type of party member has a function
		- Elf warns of immediate danger
		- Dwarf maps the dungeon
			- if he dies, the map in the screen will no longer update
		- The rest of the party members serve as both your hit points and your strength
- Combat
	- Combat is based around the number of party members
	- roll your attack, which is added to your strength to see if you hit the enemy
- Enemy
	- Every enemy in the game dies with two hits
	- they  become harder to hit
	- if they hit youâ€™ll lose up to three party members
	- guardian monster
		- if it reaches 
			- run after the player and kill one or two party members
		- they have different behaviours
			- pass through walls
- Goal
	- The goal is not to simply complete it, but to get a high score, collecting as much gold as possible

	- My party is the pink square, treasures are yellow, enemies are dark green, stairs are white and the pits are grey

	- My party battles a pack of Spiders at the fourth dungeon floor (purple and green icon). The white icon is the spectre, which will kill one of my party members if it reaches me.
