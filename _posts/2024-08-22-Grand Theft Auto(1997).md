## The Inspiration
Jones tells a story about the development of Grand Theft Auto: “Grand Theft Auto was not designed as Grand Theft Auto. It was designed as a medium. It was designed to be a living, breathing city that was fun to play.” Once the “medium” was developed and the team could see that it was a fun toy, they had to decide what game to build with it. They realized the city was like a maze, so they borrowed maze game mechanics from something they knew was good. Jones explains: “GTA came from Pac-Man. The dots are the little people. There’s me in my little, yellow car. And the ghosts are policemen.”
